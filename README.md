# Doggo-or-Kitter
Computers have a hard time distinguishing dogs from cats. So much so that this task was widely used as a CAPTCHA, known as Assira (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access). Recently, research has shown that machine learning approaches can crack Assira with an 80% success rate [1], leading to its retirement.

See this [**ongoing competition**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) to benchmark the latest computer vision and deep learning approaches to this problem.
